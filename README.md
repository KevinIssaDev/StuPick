# StuPick

#### Select a (or multiple) random student(s), create student groups of desired sizes and merge classlists.

This requires classlists being .txt files with one student name per line. E.g:

```
Kevin Issa
James Smith
Maria Brown
```

#### A version of this (with only the feature of selecting a random student from a class) is available on my website, https://kevinissa.dev/.
###### This was done for my personal use and is therefore not optimized for anything but that.
